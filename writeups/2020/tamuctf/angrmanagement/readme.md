# Angr Managemenet

As implied by the name of the challenge, the intended solution for this challenge is to solve for the required input via the [angr](https://angr.io/) symbolic execution library.

I was able to use a pretty standard solve-for-stdin-angr-template script for this. Find my solution script [here](./solve.py).
