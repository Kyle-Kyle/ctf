# SHA1 `'a'` Count

This was a simple challenge proposed during the CTF: provide hex-encoded data that, when hashed with SHA1, produces a consecutive string of `a` characters in its hash. The longest string of `a`s after 10 minutes wins. My [solution script](./solve.py) was able to come up with a hash starting with 6 `a`s.
