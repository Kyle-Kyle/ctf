# Reasonably Strong Algorithm

This is a simple RSA problem that involves factoring the modulus N to reconstruct the totient and derive the private exponent. I factored N via [FactorDB](http://factordb.com/).

For future reference, here are the system packages needed in order to `pip install gmpy2`:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev
```
